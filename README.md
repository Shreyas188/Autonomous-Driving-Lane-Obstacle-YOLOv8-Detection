# Autonomous-Driving-Lane-Obstacle-YOLOv8-Detection
Autonomous Driving — Lane & Obstacle Detection is a computer vision project that implements a real-time perception system for autonomous vehicles using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system is designed to accurately detect road lanes and obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians, and barriers from camera input.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, model training, real-time inference, and evaluation. With robust performance under diverse lighting and environmental conditions, it can be integrated into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous navigation frameworks.
